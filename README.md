# MedRecordChain

MedRecordChain is a decentralized platform for managing patient medical records and appointments using blockchain technology. It allows patients to securely store their health data on the blockchain and grants permission-based access to doctors. Built on [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2), this project ensures transparency and patient control over sensitive medical information.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Patients can store their medical records securely on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Permission-Based Access**: Only doctors granted explicit permission by a patient can access or add to that patient's medical records.
- **Appointment Booking System**: Patients can book appointments, and doctors have the option to approve or decline each request.
- **Transparent Record of Access**: Patients have a transparent view of who has access to their data and can revoke access as needed.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum
- **Blockchain Framework**: Scaffold-ETH for development and deployment
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect via `wagmi`

## üéØ Usage

### For Patients

- **Register**: Patients can register their basic information on the platform.
- **Grant Access**: Patients can grant permission to specific doctors to access their medical records.
- **Book Appointments**: Patients can book appointments with doctors who are registered on the platform.
- **Revoke Access**: Patients can revoke previously granted access to their medical records.
- **View Medical Records**: Patients can view a history of their medical records.

### For Doctors

- **Register**: Doctors can register their profile and specialization on the platform.
- **View Patient Data**: With patient-granted permission, doctors can view the patient's medical history.
- **Add Medical Records**: Doctors with access can add new medical records for the patient.
- **Approve Appointments**: Doctors can view and approve or decline appointment requests from patients.

## üìú Smart Contracts

MedRecordChain is built with Solidity smart contracts, handling the core functionality of record management and appointment booking:

- **PatientRegistry**: Manages patient data and permissions.
- **DoctorRegistry**: Handles doctor registration and access control.
- **AppointmentRegistry**: Manages appointment bookings and approvals.
